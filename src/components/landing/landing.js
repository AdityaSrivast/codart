                        The name says it all. <b>Codart = Code + Dart</b>. This unconventional combination provides for an amusing experience, and it is the USP of this very unique coding contest.<br/><br/>
The contest has two rounds, with the first round being an online test (on Hackerearth) for all teams, who have to submit their codes for as many problems as possible within the given time. The ten teams which have accumulated the highest score during round 1 are invited for the second and final round.<br/><br/>
Here, the rules are different, but the game is very simple. The problem statement which a team receives is based on where their dart lands on the dartboard, as the problemâ€™s difficulty is purely dependent on specific regions marked on the board. For example, hitting bullseye would result in the team getting one of the easiest problems in the competition, and vice-versa. Solving the problems results in gaining points. The objective is to gain maximum points in the duration of the event.<br/><br/>
Remember, there are some irresistible prizes on the line here. So, practice your throws while you scan through your favourite algorithms and libraries, and brace yourselves for the most fun coding event of the year, <b>Codart</b>.

                                teams are allowed to skip the question and throw again, but they receive a penalty for the same.</li>

                                In round 1, teams have to submit codes for given problems, and their score from each problem depends on how many test cases the code can run successfully. The more problems you solve completely, the higher your score. In round 2, just like the problem difficulty, the reward for each problem also depends on where the dart hits the dartboard.
